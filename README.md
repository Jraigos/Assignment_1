Cryptocurrency Market Data 


## Overview and Origin

* Name of the company

Coinmarketcap OpCo, LLC
(CMC)



Coinmarketcap (CMC), was founded in May 2013 by Brandon Chez in his apartment located in Queens, Long Island City, NY.

Originally Mr. Chez was looking to provide users the ability to obtain insight about cryptocurrency markets at a glance and being a neutral and accurate source for the cryptocurrency community.

So then, the idea was to provide up-to-date cryptocurrency prices, charts and data about the emerging cryptocurrency markets. 
From the very first day, the goal for the site was to be the number one location online for crypto market data and empower users with unbiased and accurate information. 
Since then, the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency has grown exponentially.

In April 2020, it was acquired by Binance Capital Mgmt.

At the beginning CMC appears to make money by selling display advertising through Alphabet Inc.’s Google. Currently, advertising continues been a source of funds for the company.
They also provide products and services that requires monthly or annual subscriptions. 

Coinmarketcap also started to receive funds to finance its projects from Binance Capital Mgmt., after the acquisition in April 2020. 







## Business Activities:

Coinmarketcap is intended to serve the personal, academic and commercial customers.
It reaches hundreds of millions of users a year through its price-tracking website, mobile app, newsletter, blog, social media (Twitter, Telegram, Facebook, Instagram) and annual conference.  1

The most remarkable advantage was gotten after it was acquired by Binance Capital Mgmt. 
Binance is the global blockchain company behind the world's largest digital asset exchange by trading volume and users, which shares the common vision of making crypto accessible and systemically important to people all around the world.
Through the acquisition, CoinMarketCap was able to tap into its parent company's extensive resources to acquire more in-depth data into projects, reduce information asymmetry in the crypto industry and bring higher-quality data to its hundreds of millions of users. 1

One of the technologies CMC is currently using is the Crypto API. 
The CoinMarketCap API is a suite of high-performance RESTful JSON endpoints that are specifically designed to meet the mission-critical demands of application developers, data scientists, and enterprise business platforms. 2
